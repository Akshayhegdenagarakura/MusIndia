        <br> Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive resource for all things related to this rich musical tradition. Indian classical music is a centuries-old art form that encompasses two main traditions: Hindustani classical music and Carnatic classical music. 
  
         Hindustani classical music is predominantly practiced in North India, while Carnatic classical music is prominent in South India. Both traditions have their unique characteristics, but they share common elements such as ragas (melodic frameworks), talas (rhythmic patterns), and improvisation. 
          
         On our website, you will find information about the history, theory, and aesthetics of Indian classical music. We delve into the intricacies of ragas and talas, exploring their melodic and rhythmic structures. Additionally, we showcase renowned artists, both past and present, who have made significant contributions to this art form.

We provide audio and video recordings, notation sheets, and articles on various aspects of Indian classical music.
