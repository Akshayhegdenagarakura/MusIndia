      <p style="color: #555;">Dance in India has an unbroken tradition of over 2000 years. Its themes are derived from mythology, legends, and classical literature. There are two main forms of dances in India. These are folk dance and classical dance. They are not simply the movement of legs and arms but of the whole body.</p>
      <p style="color: #555;">Most of the classical dances were first conceived and nurtured in the temples. They attained their full stature there. Classical dance forms are based on ancient dance discipline. They have rigid rules of presentation.</p>
      <p style="color: #555;">Indian classical dances follow the principles and rules laid down by Bharat Muni in his Natyashastra many ages ago. There are 180 styles of Indian temples. Music, dance, and drama have been an integral part of Indian religious and secular life.</p>

Folk dances imbibe new influence and at the same maintain tradition and continuity.</p>
      <p style="color: #555;">The classical dances of India are usually spiritual in content, whereas the main force behind the folk dances of India is the celebratory mood. Dances are a form of coherent expression of human feelings. These dances are not only the exclusive art of a particular community but an asset to India's cultural heritage.</p>
